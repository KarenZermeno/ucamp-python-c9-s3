For COORDENATE LOCATION, used a bucle WHILE to make sure this point isn't empty and make sure the usuary enter a correct number to assign to each coordenate. Then, comparate with an IF-ELIF if the X coordenate is bigger or less than 0 and also whit the Y coordenate to assign a quadrant ubication. If the numbers given for the usuary was 0 in both coordenate case, used an ELSE to say there is in no one quadrant.
For the WORD LENGHT, aks to the usuary to enter a word between 4 and 8 letters. Re-assign the variable to check the lenght writted. Then, check if it is less than 4 characters, it is true, send a message indicating that's not what we ask for, and include the lengh word given. At same time, it is mor than 8 characters, also told thats wrong and include the word lenght given.
